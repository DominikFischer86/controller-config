# controller-config

Overwhelmed with tons of buttons on your DUAL VKB GLADIATOR NXT/NXT EVO? Maybe this overview can help you create a config to have open on your second monitor.

You can use it on this page: https://dominikfischer86.github.io/controller-config/

- Open the respective drawer and find the accordion of your desired control input. The active one will be highlighted accordingly.
- You can add up to three entries per input action and optionally different modes for each entry.
- You can drag the boxes around at will and adjust where the lines connect from the box to the joystick (you cannot adjust the points' positions on the joystick yet)
- Saving the config will add an entry to your browser cache (localstorage), but clicking the info on the top right will enable you to download a saved config. A reupload will be added later.
- Or you can reset the config to the default layout.
